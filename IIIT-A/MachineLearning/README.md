Gradient Descent what is the use of it?
It is an optimization algorithm that is used for finding the weights or coefficients of the machine learning algorithms.


It works by minimizing the error term by taking the gradient of the cost function and then w = w - alpha*derivative to find the optimum
weights for the model.

Stotastic Gradient Descent
In stotastic gradient Descent the parameters are updated after one training example .

Mini Batch Gradient Descent
In this we divide the training set into the small batches of size 124 256 so onn so that we can overcome the more computation required in the stotastic gradient descent.

Confusion Matrix
We use the confusion matrix to calculate the accuracy of the classification.

## Errors in Linear Regression
```
The main con of using the linear regresssion is the assumption that the data is linearly
progressing which is generally not the case in real world scenario.
That means it is limited to linear relationships.

Also it assumes that the features are independent of each other (Multiple Linear Regresssion)
