## Statistics Notes

```
Variance 

How far the set of numbers are from their average
```

```
np.cov -> gives us the covariance matrix 
np.linalg.eig(conv_matrix) gives the eigen values and vectors.
```


```
Continuous And Discrete 
x belongs to any value for example the height 

discrete mein we have a fixed range only..
for example -> money you have 
```

```
Gaussian Distribution -> Mean =0 and SD = 1
